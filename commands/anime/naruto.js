He was the first character created by Kishimoto during the conception of the series and was designed with many traits from other shōnen characters. He is often ridiculed by the Konohagakure villagers, as he is the host of Kurama, the Nine-Tailed Fox that attacked Konoha. He compensates for this with his cheerful and boisterous personality, vowing to never give up on any goal he sets. In particular, Naruto has ambitions of becoming Hokage, the leader of Konohagakure, to gain the villagers' respect and be able to protect both them and the world. Over the course of the series, Naruto befriends many foreign and Konoha people and eventually gains a sizable positive impact on their lives to the point where he gains worldwide fame.[ch. 450] Naruto eventually achieves his dream of becoming Hokage, marries Hinata Hyuga and has two children named Boruto Uzumaki and Himawari Uzumaki.`)

Sasuke's older brother, Itachi Uchiha, killed the rest of their family. Because of this, Sasuke's sole desire is to kill his brother, and he develops a cold and withdrawn personality, seeing people as tools to further his goals, although also gaining the affection of most of the girls he knows, much to his annoyance. After he becomes a member of Team 7, Sasuke seems to begin considering his teammates precious to the point of risking his life to protect them, while focusing on revenge less than at the start of the series. Following an encounter and a subsequent defeat at the hands of his brother in Part I, however, Sasuke severs his ties and leaves the village to seek more power from a man named Orochimaru. By the events of the Boruto franchise, Sasuke has become a vigilante investigating the Otsutsuki clan while aiding Konohagakure. Sasuke is voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama in the Japanese anime, while his English voice actor is Yuri Lowenthal.`)

While creating the character, Kishimoto has admitted that he had little perception of what an ideal girl should be like.[1] As a child, Sakura was teased by other children because of her large forehead, a feature Kishimoto tried to emphasize in Sakura's appearance. She was comforted by Ino Yamanaka[12] and the two developed a friendship. However, as the two continued to grow, they became increasingly distant due to their shared affection for Sasuke Uchiha. During the early moments of Part I, Sakura is infatuated with Sasuke and resents Naruto Uzumaki, although Sasuke views her as annoying and Naruto has feelings for her.[ch. 3] Her perception on Naruto eventually changes, however, and she comes to see him as a friend, while her feelings for Sasuke grow into deep love. In the Japanese anime, her voice actress is Chie Nakamura, and she is voiced by Kate Higgins in the English adaptation.`)

Kakashi is a master of the Sharingan Mirror Wheel Eye, which he gained as a present from his late friend, Obito Uchiha. Kakashi's original eye was restored late into part 2 of the series. Kakashi is killed by Pain (Nagato), but is revived when Nagato uses Rinne Rebirth to restore everything. Kakashi succeeds Tsunade as the sixth Hokage in the later parts of Naruto Shippuden.`)

Though born of the Hyuga clan's main house and raised to become future head of the clan, Hinata's shyness and inability to stand up for herself resulted in the strong disapproval of her father Hiashi after being defeated by her younger sister Hanabi who became their father's successor. Hinata was then disowned by Hiashi and placed in the care of Kurenai Yuhi. Under Kurenai's guidance, Hinata began training to become strong in both skill and will in order to prove her worth to her father. Hinata's growing self-confidence mainly comes from her long-standing admiration for Naruto, as she is inspired by his enthusiasm and his unyielding determination to never give up. As the series progresses, Hinata's admiration towards Naruto eventually grows into love. During Part II, Hinata confesses her feelings to Naruto while protecting him from Pain and later assists him during the Allied Ninjas battle with the Ten-Tails. Following the end of the Fourth Great Ninja War, and the events of The Last: Naruto the Movie where she carries out the will of her ancestor Hamura Ōtsutsuki by helping Naruto stop Toneri, Hinata marries Naruto and they have two children by the series epilogue. Her voice actress in the Japanese anime is Nana Mizuki, and her English voice actress is Stephanie Sheh.`)

By Part II of the Naruto storyline, Akamaru grows large enough for Kiba to ride atop his back, but since Kiba spends so much time with Akamaru, he fails to notice this drastic difference.[ch. 282] With his heightened sense of smell, hearing, and the ability to detect others' chakra levels, Akamaru acts as a valuable tool for Kiba in hostile situations. To help Kiba keep track of opponents, Akamaru uses scent marking, though in battle he relies on Kiba to provide the chakra for the combination attacks they execute, which requires Akamaru to transform into a clone of Kiba.[ch. 203] In the series epilogue, an aged Akamaru fathers a litter of puppies that are among the assortment of animals living with Kiba and Tamaki. In the original Japanese anime, Akamaru is voiced by Junko Takeuchi, who is also the voice actor for Naruto Uzumaki, and Kōsuke Toriumi, who voices Kiba, when Akamaru transforms into a clone of Kiba.[28] In the English adaptation of the anime, Akamaru's vocal effects as a puppy are provided by Jamie Simone though Kyle Hebert provided the voice of Akamaru when he took Kiba's form.`)

During a battle, Shino directs his bugs towards an opponent, boxing them in without their knowledge and absorbing their chakra once they have been surrounded. Shino's merciless tendencies, in regards to opponents as well as his attachment to and collection of insects,[ch. 172] have caused other characters to label him as creepy.[ch. 70] Nevertheless, Shino cares deeply for his teammates, being acutely aware of their inner workings and always regretting when he is unable to help them;[ch. 238] he is also capable of childish emotions, as shown in the anime when he sulks after Naruto (who has returned to the village after two and a half years) fails to remember his name or even recognize him. In the series epilogue, Shino becomes a Ninja Academy teacher. In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is Shinji Kawada.[28] His first voice actor in the English anime was Sam Riegel, who voiced Shino in episodes 23 and 24, but in all following appearances, he has been voiced by Derek Stephen Prince.`)

Creator Kishimoto has noted that he likes Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature despite being a genius, and contrasted him against Sasuke Uchiha's intelligent but abrasive personality.[7] Shikamaru's intelligence is such that Asuma Sarutobi, Team 10's leader, has never been able to defeat Shikamaru at games such as shogi or go, and he can devise complex strategies even in the heat of battle. However, his laziness frequently prevents him from effectively utilizing his intelligence.[ch. 107] Shikamaru is a longtime friend of Choji Akimichi, as he chooses to look upon Choji as a person rather than only considering his large girth. Despite thinking of Naruto a bit poorly and often getting annoyed by him, he is one of the few people to have acknowledged him as a person rather than the tailed beast in childhood, remaining one of Naruto's close friends since then.[ch. 190] In battle, Shikamaru can manipulate his shadow, and by extending it into another person's shadow he can force the target to mimic his movements.[ch. 107] In the series epilogue, Shikamaru works as Naruto's advisor and is revealed to have married Temari who had moved to the Hidden Leaf, with whom he has a son, Shikadai. In the Japanese anime, Shikamaru's voice actor is Showtaro Morikubo, although Nobutoshi Canna acted as a stand-in for Morikubo in episode 141.[35][36] His English voice actor is Tom Gibis.`)

If someone refers to him as fat, Choji instantly becomes hostile and increases his resolve to battle,[ch. 55] even killing one of the Sound Four during one occurrence. Shikamaru Nara has never found an issue with Choji's weight, instead choosing to look upon Choji's inner strength. Because of this, Choji regards him as his best friend, stating he would willingly give his life to defend Shikamaru.[ch. 190] In battle, Choji can increase the size of his body to improve the amount of damage his strikes deal upon impact.[ch. 189] He can also use his clan's signature Calorie Control (カロリーコントロール, Karorī Kontorōru) which converts his body fat to chakra.[ch. 190] In the series epilogue, Choji ended up marrying Karui of the Hidden Cloud Village and they have a daughter Chocho Akimichi.

Ino can transfer her consciousness to her target's mind, gaining control over their body which she can then use to attack others. She can also perform telepathy by connecting minds of People, and in addition, she is a Sensory ninja, able to detect chakra around her. [ch. 55] In the series' epilogue, Ino ended up marrying Sai and they have a son, Inojin, and becoming the head of her clan and the Leader of the Village's Sensory Unit as well as a Doctor.

Though Asuma eventually returned, gaining the resolve to protect Konoha's next generation from his experiences outside his home, he never completely reconciled with his father by the time of Hiruzen's death.[ch. 314] Asuma is usually seen smoking a cigarette, but will temporarily drop the habit when something is bothering him, such as when his father died.[ch. 321] Among all his students, Asuma shares a particularly close relationship with Shikamaru Nara, often playing go or shogi together.[ch. 107] Asuma frequently appears alongside his childhood friend Kurenai Yuhi, denying having a relation before it is revealed that Kurenai is bearing his child.[ch. 140, 342] After Asuma is killed by Hidan of the criminal organization Akatsuki, Shikamaru inherited his mentor's ideals as he uses his knuckles to defeat Hidan. During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Asuma is brought back with the Reanimation Jutsu to fight for Kabuto before being defeated by his students and sealed until his soul is allowed to return to the afterlife.

Lee has adopted several of Guy's habits because of this, such as his wardrobe and his perseverance.[ch. 84] Guy has taught him a number of powerful, even forbidden, techniques.

Though a member of the branch house, Neji displays his title as a prodigy of the Hyuga throughout the series as a master of his clan's Gentle Fist style of combat that he taught to himself.[ch. 101] Originally, Neji believes in a fatalistic philosophy: that one's destiny is inescapable and that a weak person will always be weak. After being defeated in the Chunin Exams by Naruto Uzumaki, who defied his own fate by strengthening, Neji has a change of heart once uncle Hiashi reveals the full story of his father's death, Hizashi, as an act of self-sacrifice in place of his twin brother. Since then, Neji abandons his belief in determinism and resolves to get strong enough to never lose a battle and change the fates of his loved ones.[ch. 197] As the series progressed, Neji refined his Gentle Fist and devised original variations that either increase their potency or fix flaws such as the blind spot in his Byakugan.[ch. 197] Neji also remedies the estranged relations between himself and the members of the main house, resulting in his training with Hiashi and Hinata at the end of Part I. Neji is killed during the Fourth Great Ninja War as he sacrifices himself to protect Naruto and Hinata from Obito Uchiha's attack, telling Naruto that he made the choice to die protecting those dear to him as his father had. Following the war's conclusion, a memorial is held in Neji's honor. Years after the war, Naruto pays tribute to Neji by naming his son Boruto whose names means bolt while Neji's name means screw.

During a fight, she uses the hundreds of weapons stored in scrolls she carries with her to bombard opponents with pinpoint accuracy. Tenten uses this expertise to help Neji Hyuga train his defensive techniques, and she holds him in high regard since he can always block her attacks.[ch. 98] In the series epilogue, Tenten runs her own weapons shop and was a proctor of the Chunin exams.

Throughout the series, Kakashi has never displayed a particular interest in their rivalry, which only further motivates Guy to defeat Kakashi and his coolness.[ch. 65] Guy is an extremely capable ninja as seen in his fight against Itachi Uchiha and his recurring confrontations with Kisame Hoshigaki,[ch. 143] beating him single-handedly on two occasions.[ch. 258][ch. 506] During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Guy is forced to use the Eighth Gate in a failed attempt to defeat Madara.

He also possesses the large puppet Salamander (山椒魚, Sanshōuo) that provides him with combination defense and offense.

As White Zetsu is an extension of the Shinju, he can merge into the ground or vegetation to quickly travel to a new location or separate himself from the part of his body holding Black Zetsu and uses spores to create clones of himself or whoever he touches.[ch. 289] This makes Zetsu not only of use to the Akatsuki as a spy, but also to devour bodies of deceased Akatsuki members or those that the organization does not want found.[ch. 255, 261] Another of the White Zetsu that Black Zetsu brought out of the Gedo Statue, initially referred to as Guruguru (グルグル) due to the spiral-shaped pattern on his body, is later named Tobi (トビ) and served as an exosuit for Obito while the youth was getting used to his new body.

Seeing Kaguya being sealed away again, Black Zetsu is thrown by Naruto into the forming moon so he would not make another attempt to free his creator.[ch. 681, 688, 690] Tobi, having participated in the war by encasing Yamato to access his Wood-Style before ejecting him once Madara succeeds in casting the Infinite Tsukiyomi, is last seen crumbling after the jutsu is canceled with his former captive the only witness to his death.[ch. 699].

While Konan's abilities are restricted when the paper is wet, since paper will cling to itself and lose its stiffness, she is able to use this weakness to her advantage as she implements explosive tags into her paper clones. After Nagato's death, Konan withdraws her position in the Akatsuki and proclaims loyalty to Naruto.[ch. 372] Later, she is confronted by Obito over the location of Nagato's Rinnegan eyes.She fights him in a suicide assault, though is killed after being forced to reveal Nagato's resting place.

As the strongest shinobi of his time, Hashirama was far too strong for Kakuzu, and as such, the mission failed, with Kakuzu barely escaping with his life. Kakuzu returned to his village, and despite the overwhelming danger and risk he faced, he was dishonoured and severely punished unjustly. Gaining a violent for hatred for his village because of this unfair treatment, despite his loyalty and for his risking his life, Kakuzu escaped from prison and, in an act of vengeance and retaliation, brutally betrayed his village, stole the forbidden techniques of his village and murdered the village elders (as well as carving out their hearts), becoming a rogue ninja in the process. Kakuzu's body is composed of a large number of black threads, allowing him to reattach any body part, being his or another, back onto its owner. The threads are also capable of piercing flesh, which Kakuzu uses to remove the still-beating hearts of his opponents for his personal use and integrates their hearts into his body to extend his life indefinitely.[69] Kakuzu can store up to four spare hearts in animal masks that are sewn to his back, which can be detached during combat situations to shoot elemental blasts at his opponents, and quickly recalled to his body if he needs a replacement heart.[ch. 336] Kakuzu's hearts are systematically destroyed soon after his introduction by a group of Konohagakure ninja.

However, motivated by his desire to make works that last forever, Sasori secretly devised a way to convert the corpses of humans into puppets, allowing him to use any of the ninja abilities they possessed during their lives for himself. Leaving Sunagakure in his teenage, Sasori later kidnapped the Third Kazekage, transforming him into a human puppet and using him as his main weapon.[ch. 267] Sasori's desire was to become art, so he converted his own body into a puppet, which essentially gives him eternal life and allows him to control hundreds of puppets at once.[ch. 271] After joining the Akatsuki, Sasori was paired with Orochimaru, and after his desertion, he was teamed with Deidara, who looks up to him and his artistic knowledge with reverence.[ch. 248] [ch. 263] In the Akatsuki, Sasori spent most of the time hidden inside Hiruko, a human puppet who served as both weapon and armour, which he adorned with the Akatsuki's robe.

He is very arrogant about his immense battle prowess. Though he was a childhood friend of Hashirama amidst the conflicts of their respective clan, their friendship ends as a result of the war. As the leader of the Uchiha clan, Madara's overuse of Mangekyo Sharingan blinds him, forcing him to take the eyes of his late younger brother Izuna. This allows Madara to use his newly awakened Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan to continue the ongoing war between the Uchiha and the Senju.[ch. 386] In later years, Hashirama comes forth with a peace offering between the two clans.

He is considered as the most powerful Water Style user and is known throughout the Ninja World for creating the Flying Thunder God Jutsu (飛雷神の術, Hiraishin no Jutsu), the Shadow Clone Jutsu, and the controversial Reanimation Jutsu, although he abandoned its completion due to its sinister nature.[ch. 520] He has high knowledge of the Uchiha anatomy and source of their power. In flashbacks, he disapproves of Hashirama's friendship with Madara Uchiha even after the rival clans had reconciled, eventually leading to Madara's departure. Tobirama's time as Hokage is short-lived as he is killed in an ambush during the First Great Ninja War.[ch. 501] He is later brought back by the Reanimation Jutsu after it was perfected by Orochimaru and forced to battle Hiruzen.[ch. 118] Tobirama is later brought back again to inform Sasuke Uchiha about the Uchiha Clan and to participate in the battle against the Ten Tails.

Throughout the series, he acts as a source of wisdom to younger generations; and from the start, is one of the few characters to treat Naruto Uzumaki as a person rather than the host of Kurama.[ch. 2] He was admired as the God of Shinobi in his prime,[ch. 121] and also known as The Professor (プロフェッサー, Purofessā), as he purportedly knew every jutsu in Konohagakure.[ch. 121] He is able to use the Summoning Jutsu, which allows him to summon the Monkey King: Enma (猿猴王・猿魔, Enkōō: Enma), who takes the form of a long rod when not summoned.[ch. 120] He is also the teacher of Jiraiya, Orochimaru, and Tsunade. Orochimaru is his favorite student, and Sarutobi could never bring himself to recognize Orochimaru's evil qualities. When Orochimaru invades Konoha years later, Sarutobi fights him to repent for never prosecuting Orochimaru as he should have.[ch. 121] While he is unable to seal Orochimaru with the forbidden Death Seal, Hiruzen still manages to rob Orochimaru of his ability to use Jutsu by sealing his arms, thus bringing an end to the invasion and allowing him to die happily.[ch. 137] During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Orochimaru releases Hiruzen's soul from the Death Seal and reanimates him so Sasuke can confirm the events behind the Uchiha Clan Massacre.

Despite her connections to the first three Hokage, Tsunade hates the position when she is first introduced. After her boyfriend Dan Katō and brother Nawaki Senju die in pursuit of their dreams to become Hokage, she loses faith in the title and the concept of dreams. She regains her faith in both after meeting Naruto Uzumaki, who consistently overcomes any obstacle in his own dreams of being Hokage.[ch. 172] As a result, Tsunade accepts the position of Fifth Hokage (五代目火影, Godaime Hokage) to protect Konohakagure on behalf of everyone she has loved,[ch. 169] also later taking Sakura as her apprentice, much like Orochimaru with Sasuke and Jiraiya with Naruto.

Despite the importance of her position, Tsunade tends to laze around and avoid her everyday duties, instead leaving them for her assistant Shizune. She does however take her role very seriously in situations where Konoha is in danger, and throughout Part II leads the village in combating the Akatsuki.[ch. 238] Tsunade is a compulsive gambler with terrible luck, though with a rare winning streak perceived by her as a bad omen. Despite her odd personality, Tsunade is a highly talented medical ninja who can heal injuries that most others would consider incurable, and also possesses superhuman strength that allows her to reduce buildings to rubble. The pinnacle of her skills is the Creation Rebirth jutsu and its derived technique, the Strength of a Hundred Technique, which she taught to her disciple Sakura. This way, both Tsunade and Sakura use mitotic regeneration to make them nearly unkillable in battle. In the Japanese anime, Tsunade's voice actress is Masako Katsuki, and her English voice actress is Debi Mae West.[28][81] In some of the video games, however, her English voice actress is Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.`)

Ao then goes after Danzo's group when they flee during Taka's attack, only to saved by Mei and Chōjūrō when he fell into a trap that Danzo's men set up in an attempt to retrieve his Byakugan. Ao serves in the Allied Shinobi Forces as captain of the Sensor Division stationed in the Shinobi Alliance Headquarters in Kumogakure, barely surviving the Ten Tails' Tailed Beast Bomb when it obliterated their base. As later revealed have survived in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, his body augmented with Shinobi-Ware prosthetics that include a Type-3 Shinobi Gauntlet replacing his left forearm, an older Ao had become a sleeper agent for the Kara. He engaged Team Konohamaru and Katasuke, using of the latter's inventions to kill his aide while wounded Konohamaru. A revenge-driven Boruto manages to outwit and overpower Ao, sparing the man's life as Ao ends up sacrificing himself to save Boruto from being crushed by Kashin Koji's Boiler Toad. He is voiced by Tadahisa Saizen in the Japanese anime, while Steven Blum voices him in the English adaptation.`)

He is very proud, despite his frailty,[ch. 454] and shows little respect to those much younger than him. During the Kage Summit, he admitted to have frequently hired Akatsuki members.[ch. 458][ch. 459] While Onoki justify hiring the Akatsuki as necessary in protecting his village during its demilitarization, both it and his advanced age kept him from being named leader of the Shinobi Alliance though Sasuke's intrusion and Gaara's conduct cause Onoki to regain some of more noble traits from his youth. Later, he goes out to find Kabuto and prevent him from finding Killer Bee and Naruto and succeeds in protecting them. Throughout the war, Onoki's techniques proved instrumental in keeping Alliance members alive and he becomes the de facto leader in the assault against the real Madara Uchiha. Years later, Onoki retires due to his failing health and passes down his title to his granddaughter, Kurotsuchi. In the Boruto series, following an attack on his village by a rogue ninja a decade after the Fourth Great Ninja War that took the life of his grandson Kozuchi, Onoki began to develop the Akuta as a defense force to keep people safe and unharmed. He continued perfecting the process after receiving a White Zetsu's remains, improving on the Akuta while creating Fabrications like his partial clone son Kū as he orchestrated Mitsuki's abduction to refine the process. But upon seeing the extent the Fabrications would go to see his ideals realized, Onoki helps Boruto stop the artificial humans at the cost of his life. Onoki is voiced by Tomomichi Nishimura in the Japanese anime and Steven Blum in the English adaptation.`)

Through Obito's scheme, Kurama is released and attacks Konohagakure before being stopped by the Fourth Hokage Minato Namikaze, who seals the fox's Yin half within himself. Following this, Minato and Kushina sacrifice themselves to seal the weakened Yang Kurama within their son, Naruto Uzumaki, twelve years before the series' start.[ch. 1][ch. 500] Throughout the series, Naruto tries to harness Kurama's immense chakra to perform several jutsu that would normally be impossible for a shinobi of his age.[ch. 95] But Naruto soon learns that relying too much on Kurama's power would allow the fox to impose its will over its host to the point of breaking the seal. Naruto eventually takes control of the fox's chakra with help from an imprint of Kushina.[ch. 499] During Naruto's fight against Obito, seeing its host's resolve to save the other Tailed Beasts, Kurama befriends Naruto by allowing him to achieve Tailed Beast Mode.[ch. 571] Eventually, as Kurama is extracted from Naruto, the Tailed Beast tells Gaara how to save Naruto's life by transferring Yin Kurama from Minato into Naruto. Kurama is later returned to its Jinchuriki's body and becomes whole again as it reunites with its Yin counterpart. Kishimoto was mainly inspired to create Kurama based on the character with the same name from the manga series YuYu Hakusho.[90] The inclusion of the fox spirit was also inspired by Godzilla.[91] In the Japanese anime, Kurama's voice actor is Tesshō Genda, and in the English adaptation, he is voiced by Paul St. Peter.`)
